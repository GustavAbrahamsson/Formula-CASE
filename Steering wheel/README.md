# FC_Wheel PCB
## v1.0
### Issues:
- The ESP receives 2.4V even though the LDO outputs 3.3V
  - Use larger vias
- The BOOT and RESET push-buttons need to be more accessable and easier to press
  - Use 'longer' push-buttons with the same footprint
- The battery pins need labels
- The holes are not aligned for the MPU6050 footprint
